# Calendar
First mini project in C . A calendar where a user can select any year and month using arrow keys.


First commit .
This program accepts the year and the month required by the user, and displays the entire month on the screen.
Apart from this fundamental functioning, after the month is displayed, we have included the scenario in which the user wants to see the next or previous month or year.
Also, the input which the user gives for the month required, can be in the form of an integer(month number), the month name( for example 'January') or the short form of the month name( for example 'Jan'). If the user fails to input a valid month more than thrice, the program also analyses his inputs and suggests a month accordingly.
Moreover, we have also bookmarked important dates of the British calendar in our program( for example 1st january - New Year,25th December - Christmas etc).
